#HomeBreaks Inc, Find a place to stay!

##Overview
This application manages a collection of small properties for short-term lease by hosts to renting guests. The system will capture details about the properties, their
hosts and guests, and will manage bookings and reviews of the properties. The security aspect is that contact details for individuals and the precise locations of properties are not revealed to a casual enquirer, but only to authorised users, according to the business rules. The different kinds of stakeholder include host, guest and enquirer roles. Hosts supply all information about the properties offered for lease and accept bookings from guests. Guests make bookings for properties for short periods and write reviews about their stay. Enquirers are future guests, who search for properties to rent during a period, before they make a booking.
